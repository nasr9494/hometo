This is a simple webpage that explains the significance of the colors in the **Sudanese flag**. The webpage features four main sections, each dedicated to a specific color from the flag: Red, Green, White, and Black. Each section provides an explanation of what the color represents in the context of Sudan's culture and historical tourist destination.

- **Educational Content**: Each section describes the meaning behind one of the four colors in the Sudanese flag.
- **Color-coded Sections**: The background color of each section corresponds to the color being described, making it visually engaging.
- **Footer**: Includes a footer with a simple horizontal black line at the bottom for styling.
